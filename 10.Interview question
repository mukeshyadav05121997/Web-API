1. Why is the Web API important?
Web API is generally considered as a service that basically provides us information or data from the server. It is very important because of the following reasons:

It is used to provide an interface for websites and client applications to have access to data.
It can also be used to access data from the database and save data back to the database.
It supports different text formats such as XML, JSON, etc.
It is suitable or compatible with any type of browser and any type of device like mobile, desktop, web, etc.
It uses low bandwidth such as XML or JSON data, etc., and is therefore considered good for devices that have limited bandwidth such as smartphones, etc.
From a business point of view, web API is more applicable for UI/UX, increases interest in the company’s product and services, increases website traffic.

2.Explain media type formatters.
In web API, media type formatters are classes that are responsible for serialization data. Here, serialization generally means a process of translating data into a format that can be transmitted and reconstructed later.  Because of serializing request/response data, Web API can understand request data format in a better way and send data in a format that the client expects. It simply specifies data that is being transferred among client and server in HTTP response or request.

What is XML and JSON?
XML (Extensible Markup Language): 

It is especially designed to store and transport data.
It is similar to HTML but is more flexible than HTML because it allows users to create their own custom tags.
It is used for representing structured information such as documents, data, configuration, etc.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): 

It is a lightweight format designed to store and transport data.
It is easier to understand and is a standard text-based format used for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.
It is faster and easier to use. 
14. What are Web API filters?
Filters are basically used to add extra logic at different levels of Web API framework request processing.  Different types of Web API filters are available as given below:

Authentication Filter: It handles authentication and authenticates HTTP requests. It also helps to authenticate user detail. It checks the identity of the user.
Authorization Filter: It handles authorization. It runs before controller action. This filter is used to check whether or not a user is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, then it returns an HTTP status code 401 without invoking the action.
AuthorizeAttribute is a built-in authorization filter provided by Web API.
Action Filter: It is attributing that one can apply to controller action or entire controller. It is used to add extra logic before or after controller action executes. It is simply a way to add extra functionality to Web API services.
Exception Filter: It is used to handle exceptions that are unhandled in Web API. It is used whenever controller actions throw an unhandled exception that is not HttpResponseException. It will implement an “IExceptionFilter” interface.
Override Filter: It is used to exclude specific action methods or controllers from the global filter or controller level filter. It is simply used to modify the behavior of other filters for individual action methods.
